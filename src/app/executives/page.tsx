My name is Cris and I’m enchanted to be the new VP of the Sheridan Swiftie Club this year! The good news about that is that I have a place where I can talk about music that I enjoy with other people without being judged!

I'm in my Taylor Swift's 1989 era because I'm embracing a season of reinvention and self-discovery, much like how Taylor redefined her sound with this album. It's a time of feeling empowered, letting go of the past, and confidently stepping into new opportunities. *1989* represents a mix of nostalgia and forward momentum for me—I'm celebrating personal growth while enjoying life's vibrant moments, just like the upbeat and adventurous vibes of the album. More events and publicizing the club more. " />
